# Uptane Test Plan
This repository hosts the Uptane Test Plan. This test plan is intended to help Uptane adopters demonstrate that their implementation follows the requirements of the Uptane Standard.

A test plan will be prepared for each published version of the Uptane Standard listing the requirements for compliance with that version of the Standard.

## Goals
The goal of this test plan is to provide a framework for verifying that an implementation meets all of the MUSTs and SHALLs stated in the Uptane Standard.

## Non-Goals
Results of the tests contained in this plan do not confer any type of official certification, or assure compliance with the Uptane Standard.

In addition, this test plan does not provide a complete set of tests for an implementation. The SHOULDs and MAYs referenced in the Standard, any best practices as described in the Deployment pages, and any implementation-specific features are not included in this plan. Implementers should write their own test cases to cover all features added to their implementation.
